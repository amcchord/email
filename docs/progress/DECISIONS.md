# Decisions

Durable decisions are numbered and never silently removed. If a choice changes,
add a new entry that explicitly supersedes the old one.

## D-001 — Git-first staging workflow

- Date: 2026-08-26
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Use this local checkout for development and `origin/main` as the
  code source of truth. Use `/opt/mail` only as the production deployment
  target.
- Reason: Keeps review, testing, history, and recovery available while avoiding
  configuration drift from direct server edits.
- Consequence: Emergency live changes must be reconciled back into Git
  immediately.

## D-002 — Production mutations require explicit scope

- Date: 2026-08-26
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Read-only production inspection may support normal work. Deploys,
  restarts, migrations, configuration edits, and data changes require an
  explicit request in the current task.
- Reason: The host is actively processing private mail and root SSH access has a
  large blast radius.
- Consequence: Completing a local change does not imply deploying it.

## D-003 — Progress lives beside the code

- Date: 2026-08-26
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Keep current state, session evidence, durable decisions, and the
  operations runbook in version-controlled Markdown.
- Reason: Future work should resume from repository state rather than private
  chat history.
- Consequence: Material sessions update `CURRENT.md` and `JOURNAL.md`; durable
  choices update this file.

## D-004 — Never mirror production secrets into staging

- Date: 2026-08-26
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Do not copy `/opt/mail/.env`, databases, mailbox content,
  attachments, OAuth tokens, or private logs into the staging checkout.
- Reason: The local workspace is a code and documentation home base, not a
  production data replica.
- Consequence: Local integration work uses fakes or separately provisioned
  non-production credentials.
